## What is mrGateway?
_______________

The goal of mrGateway (Microservice Rudimentary Gateway) is to allow for fast setup and integration with a microservice built to handle gRPC/REST requests of other services.
This service will connect with mrCache to give the ability to cache responses from other services in a single place if caching doesn't exist already for your application.
This service will take in a request and forward it to the appropriate service and return the response to the requester.
